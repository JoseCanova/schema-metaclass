### Prepare for next development cycle, that  will be generate the metamodel to describe rdbms relations (fk`s relations). 
#### Then after generate the metamodel to describe such relations to provide the elements for the class generation algorithm. 

##### Reducing the scope of the component, which means remove experimental algorithms for table classification.
##### Experimental Table classification algorithms will be removed from the component,first because data scanning, second because it overhelm the component main objective that is mount a metamodel based on schemacrawler datasctructures.
##### Table classification will be moved to attic and in future (if possible) being implemented with an ai-powered component.
